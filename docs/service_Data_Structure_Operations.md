# Service Idea: Data Structure Operations API

## Concept
A RESTful API service that allows users to interact with various data structures like stacks, queues, and maps. Users can perform operations such as insert, delete, and retrieve elements. This service could serve educational purposes or as a backend utility for applications requiring dynamic data structure manipulation.

### Define the API Specification
Before coding, define your API using OpenAPI Specification (OAS). This specification outlines your endpoints, request bodies, responses, and potential error messages. For this example, let's define a simple API for a stack data structure:

* POST /stack: Create a new stack.
* POST /stack/push: Push an item onto the stack.
* GET /stack/pop: Pop an item from the stack.
* GET /stack/peek: Peek at the top item of the stack without removing it.

### Implement the Service Logic
Structure 

```
/cmd
    /server         # Entry point for the server
/internal
    /app            # Application logic (use cases)
        /handlers   # HTTP handlers that call use case functions
    /domain         # Domain models and interfaces
        /stack      # Stack implementation
    /infra          # Infrastructure (e.g., database, web server setup)

```
[**Domain Layer**](clean_architecture_layers.md#domain-layer): Start by implementing the data structure logic.

[**Application Layer**](clean_architecture_layers.md#application-layer): Implement the application logic that uses the stack. This layer will handle the business logic of your API, such as creating a new stack and performing operations on it.

[**Infrastructure Layer**](clean_architecture_layers.md#infrastructure-layer): Set up the HTTP server and handlers that connect your API endpoints to the application logic.

### OpenAPI Specification and Code Generation

With your API endpoints defined in the OpenAPI Specification, you can use tools like `swagger-codegen` or **`openapi-generator`** to generate boilerplate code for your server and potentially a client SDK in various programming languages.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Before implementing the handlers and application logic, write tests. For the stack, tests could include pushing items to the stack, popping items, and peeking at the top item. 

### Implementing Tests and Handlers
After defining your tests, implement the handlers in your infrastructure layer that utilize your application logic to serve the API endpoints. Ensure each handler is tested with unit tests for expected behavior and error handling.

### Integration and End-to-End Testing

Once unit tests pass and your application logic is integrated with the HTTP server, perform integration tests to ensure the system works as expected when components interact. End-to-end tests can simulate real user scenarios, testing the API from the client's perspective.
